## ðŸ“Š Overview
This project uses Python, scikit-learn, and yfinance to analyze stock market data and predict future price movements.  
It fetches long-term historical data from Yahoo Finance, engineers trend-based features, and evaluates a Random Forest Classifier through rolling backtests.

## Features
- Fetches full stock history automatically from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)
- Cleans and prepares price, volume, and date-indexed data
- Generates technical indicators over multiple time horizons
- Implements a Random Forest model for directional prediction
- Performs backtesting to simulate realistic rolling forecasts
- Calculates precision scores and visualizes performance
